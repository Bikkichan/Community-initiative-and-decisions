# Community issues decisions

## Exploritory data analysis to undstand important issues within the community and determine the area of focus with the most impact to the community


### Brief
---

You have been recruited by your hometown mayor to be a part of a new data analysis team to give policy advice. Due to budget constraints the "team" is just you...

The mayor wants to start a new initiative to move the needle on one of two separate issues: high school education outcomes, or drug abuse in the community.

You have been provided with two national datasets: one on SAT scores by state and one on drug use by age. Start exploring these to look for useful patterns and possible hypotheses!
